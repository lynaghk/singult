          From the Latin; "a hiccup, a speech broken by sobs"

JavaScript implementation of Hiccup HTML templating library.
This implementation is speed; all other concerns are secondary.

Hiccup vectors in JS are arrays of the form

    ["tag", {map: "of attributes"}, child1, child2, ... ]

The attribute map and children are optional. The children must be:

+ hiccup arrays
+ explodey arrays of the form `[":*:", hiccup1, hiccup2, ...]` that
  will be exploded in place (like seqs in clj hiccup)
+ strings, which will be rendered as text nodes
+ numbers, which are rendered as text nodes via `.toString()`
+ unify structs containing data, mapping from datum -> hiccup
  array, and key-fn. Singult will perform D3.js-like unification
  against existing DOM nodes.

Compilation occurs in two steps; first the array is converted to a
canonical map representation:

    {  "nsp": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
     , "tag": "tag"
     , "attr":  {"attribute", "values"}
     , "children": children }

which is then rendered to DOM elements.

Install / Use
--------------
Singult can be used from ClojureScript or JavaScript.
For ClojureScript, just add

    [com.keminglabs/singult "0.1.3"]

to your `project.clj`. If you are not using lein cljsbuild >= 0.2.1,
you must add `:libs ["singult"]` to your ClojureScript compiler
settings. Singult fully supports Google Closure's advanced compilation
mode.

Singult provides some functions and a datatype.

+ `render` takes a hiccup array (described above) and returns a live
DOM node.

+ `merge!` takes a live DOM node and a hiccup array, and projects the
latter onto the former. That is, the live node (and its children, if
any) will be given the attributes and inline styles of the node(s)
described by the hiccup vector. Merging is useful compared to removing
and re-rendering and appending a node and its children because it
maintains object consistency, which allows you to use CSS animations
and directly-attached event handlers.

+ `attr` takes a live DOM node and a map of keywords to attribute
values. The keywords `:style` and `:properties` should be given
another map, the keys and values of which will be used to set the
styles and node properties. E.g.,

    (attr $my-checkbox {:id "Foo"
                        :style {:background-color "red"}
                        :properties {:checked true}})


+ `unify` takes an array of data and a function with signature
(datum -> hiccup vector) and returns a product datatype that `render`
and `merge` understand. `render` simply runs the mapping function
across all of the data and explodes the result in place. Thus

```clojure
[:ol (unify (range 3) (fn [x] [:li x]))]
```

is, to `render`, the same as

```clojure
[:ol
  [:li 0]
  [:li 1]
  [:li 2]]
```

In the case of `merge`, elements will be added, removed, or updated on
the DOM according to a key function.
This key function defaults to index, but can specified as an optional
argument to `unify`, as can custom enter, update, and exit functions.
See [C2](http://github.com/lynaghk/c2/) or [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)
for more on this idea.

+ `node-data` Takes a live DOM node created by rendering or merging of
a `Unify` and returns the same data given to the mapping fn.

JavaScript usage
----------------
Singult can also be used by our JavaScript friends; if you're using
Google Closure, just incorporate the 
[unminified file](https://github.com/downloads/lynaghk/singult/Singult.js)
into your build chain. There is also a 
[minified build](https://github.com/downloads/lynaghk/singult/singult.min.js)
if you don't want to mess with any of that fanciness. The minified
build adds a `singult` object to the global namespace with function
properties:

    attr($node, attr_map)   // (Side effects)
    merge($node, hiccup_array) // (Side effects)

    node_data($node)       
      //=> (data attached to node during Unify expansion)
    Unify(data, mapping, key_fn, enter, update, exit) 
      //=> Unify instance
    render($node, hiccup_array) //=> (Live DOM node)





Development / Testing
----------------------
You'll need Ruby toys:

    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    bundle exec guard

PhantomJS must be installed to run tests:

    lein cljsbuild test

will compile and run all tests. Alternatively, open
`public/index.html` in your favorite browser.
Minimal JS API test in `test/integration/js_api_test.html`.

Jasmine specs in `/spec` will be fleshed out more if our JavaScript
friends start using the library.
